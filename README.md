# Centrify-Thycotic "Vault Sync" tools
These scripts take in number of parameters to successfully update objects in Centrify Platform.

# Configuration
Configuration at Secret Server Web server or distributed engine:
1. On the Windows machine where PowerShell is run, install Centrify Platform PowerShell SDK https://github.com/centrify/powershell-sdk

Configuration at Centrify Platform:
1. Create a service account that has sufficient permissions to update password of the accounts in question. This service account is used by the script to authenticate against Centrify Platform.
2. Create a OAuth2 web application with confidential client type. For details, refer to https://github.com/centrify/centrifycli/wiki/Configuring-Centrify-Service-OAuth-for-Centrify-CLI
3. Assign service account the "Run" permission to OAuth2 web application
4. Create necessary system/database/domain accounts that are to be updated by this script and make sure they are not managed by Centrify Platform 

Configuration at Secret Server:
1. Perform necessary configurations to allow PowerShell script to be run properly either in web server or distributed engine. https://docs.thycotic.com/ss/10.9.0/api-scripting/configuring-winrm-powershell
1. Create a dependency script with this content
3. Create a secret that vaults Centrify Platform service account
4. Create or update existing secret(s) to add Centrify Platform service account as associated secret
5. Add a new dependency to run the script with arguments examples like this:
	Ex:
    "<Centrify Platform URL>" "$[1]$USERNAME" "$[1]$PASSWORD" "<OAuth2 AppID>" "<OAuth2 Scope>" system "$MACHINE" "$USERNAME" "$PASSWORD"
	"<Centrify Platform URL>" "$[1]$USERNAME" "$[1]$PASSWORD" "<OAuth2 AppID>" "<OAuth2 Scope>" database "$SERVER" "$USERNAME" "$PASSWORD"
	"<Centrify Platform URL>" "$[1]$USERNAME" "$[1]$PASSWORD" "<OAuth2 AppID>" "<OAuth2 Scope>" domain "$DOMAIN" "$USERNAME" "$PASSWORD"

# To Do
- Document OAuth2 setup on Centrify side (App should be named "SecretServer" by default and use a restricted scope as requires SysAdmin privileges)
- Add Logging capability to scripts (write events into Log file with preset Log level)
- Script cannot support renaming of secrets or systems, must implement UUID/SecretID storage on one side or the other to allow unique mapping)
- May need to implement missing Cmdlets in Centrify SDK: New-VaultDomain, New-VaultDatabase, New-VaultCloudProvider, Get-VaultCloudProvider, Set-VaultCloudProvider
